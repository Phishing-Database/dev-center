            ### Verification Step Required

            @${issueAuthor}, thank you for submitting a false positive report! To help us **verify** your ownership of the affected domain(s), please complete the following steps:

            1. Set a **DNS TXT record** for the domain(s) listed in this issue with the following details:
                - **Record Name**: \`_phishingdb\`
                - **Record Value**: \`antiphish-${verificationId}\`

                **Your Verification ID**: \`antiphish-${verificationId}\`

            2. Wait for DNS propagation (this may take a few minutes to a few hours).

            3. Reply to this issue once the TXT record has been set.

            #### Important Notes

            - **Verification does not guarantee whitelisting**. The Phishing.Database team will review your report after verifying ownership, but the decision to whitelist depends on further investigation and analysis.
            - If the record cannot be set or you need alternative methods of verification, please contact us at [contact@phish.co.za](mailto:contact@phish.co.za) - preferably from the domain's official email address.

            #### How to Check the TXT Record ?

            You can verify that the TXT record is properly set using:
            - Online tools like [Google's Dig Tool](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/) or [MXToolBox TXT Lookup](https://mxtoolbox.com/TXTLookup.aspx).
            - The command line:
                \`\`\`
                dig TXT example.com
                \`\`\`

            Thank you for your cooperation! The Phishing Database team will address your issue as soon as possible after verification.
